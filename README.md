## Description

Deluge is a full-featured ​BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. It uses ​libtorrent in its backend and features multiple user-interfaces including: GTK+, web and console. It has been designed using the client server model with a daemon process that handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely from any platform.<br/>

This Docker includes OpenVPN and WireGuard to ensure a secure and private connection to the Internet, including use of iptables to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel is down. It also includes Privoxy to allow unfiltered access to index sites, to use Privoxy please point your application at `http://<host ip>:8118`.

## Build notes

## IMPORTANT

Please note `VPN_INPUT_PORTS` is **NOT** to define the incoming port for the VPN, this environment variable is used to define port(s) you want to allow in to the VPN network when network binding multiple containers together, configuring this incorrectly with the VPN provider assigned incoming port COULD result in IP leakage, you have been warned!.

## OpenVPN

Please note this Docker image does not include the required OpenVPN configuration file and certificates. These will typically be downloaded from your VPN providers website (look for OpenVPN configuration files), and generally are zipped.

PIA users - The URL to download the OpenVPN configuration files and certs is:-

[PIA OpenVPN configuration](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip)

Once you have downloaded the zip (normally a zip as they contain multiple ovpn files) then extract it to /config/openvpn/ folder (if that folder doesn't exist then start and stop the docker container to force the creation of the folder).

If there are multiple ovpn files then please delete the ones you don't want to use (normally filename follows location of the endpoint) leaving just a single ovpn file and the certificates referenced in the ovpn file (certificates will normally have a crt and/or pem extension).

## WireGuard

If you wish to use WireGuard (defined via 'VPN_CLIENT' env var value ) then due to the enhanced security and kernel integration WireGuard will require the container to be defined with privileged permissions and sysctl support, so please ensure you change the following docker options:-  <br/>

from

``` bash
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
```

to

``` bash
    --sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1" \
    --privileged=true \
```

**PIA users** - The WireGuard configuration file will be auto generated and will be stored in ```/config/wireguard/wg0.conf``` AFTER the first run, if you wish to change the endpoint you are connecting to then change the ```Endpoint``` line in the config file (default is Netherlands).

**Other users** - Please download your WireGuard configuration file from your VPN provider, start and stop the container to generate the folder ```/config/wireguard/``` and then place your WireGuard configuration file in there.

## Notes

Due to Google and OpenDNS supporting EDNS Client Subnet it is recommended NOT to use either of these NS providers.
The list of default NS providers in the above example(s) is as follows:-

84.200.x.x = DNS Watch<br/>
37.235.x.x = FreeDNS<br/>
1.x.x.x = Cloudflare

---
User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:-

`id <username>`

---
If you are using VPN provider PIA or ProtonVPN and wish to share the assigned dynamic incoming port with another docker container running in the same network then this can be done via a docker volume, so add the following to your docker run command:-

``` bash
    -v <name of volume>:/shared \
```

e.g.

```bash
    -v binhex-shared:/shared \
```

The incoming port will then be available in `/shared/getvpnport`.
